Official implementation of paper *Search and Refine During Think: Autonomous Retrieval‚ÄëAugmented Reasoning of LLMs*.

AutoRefine is an RL post-training framework that adopts a new "search-and-refine-during-think" paradigm. It introduces:
- explicit **knowledge refinement steps** between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer.
- tailored **retrieval-specific rewards** alongside answer correctness rewards to guide the searching behaviors.

## üõ†Ô∏èInstallation

**Main Environment**

The enrivonment for training/testing of AutoRefine can be built by running:

```bash
conda create -n autorefine python=3.9
conda activate autorefine
pip install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip3 install vllm==0.5.4

# build verl
pip install -e .

# flash attention 2
pip install flash-attn==2.7.0.post2
pip install wandb
```

**Retrieval Environment**

This environment is for the local retrieval server.

```bash
conda create -n faiss_env python=3.10
conda activate faiss_env

conda install pytorch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install transformers datasets pyserini

conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.8.0

pip install uvicorn fastapi
```

## üí´Quick Start

To quickly test the model, you can run the demo script:

1. Start the retrieval server:
```bash
conda activate faiss_env
bash retrieval_launch.sh
```
Please refer to the [Retrieval Corpus](#retrieval-corpus) section for the preparation of the retrieval corpus.
This won't take long if your internet connection is good.

2. Run the demo script:
```bash
conda activate autorefine
python demo.py
```
This will start a Gradio interface where you can input questions and see the model's responses.

If you prefer a local inference without the Gradio interface, you can directly run the inference script:
```bash
conda activate autorefine
python infer.py
```
This will print the model's response to the console. You may modify the `infer.py` script to change the input question or adjust the model parameters.

## üìÇData Preparation

### Retrieval Corpus

```bash
save_path=./data
python preprocess/download.py --save_path $save_path
cat $save_path/part_* > $save_path/e5_Flat.index
gzip -d $save_path/wiki-18.jsonl.gz
```

### Training/Evaluation Dataset

We download the data for model training/evaluation from [FlashRAG Collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG_datasets).

To download and build the dataset, run:
```bash
bash preprocess/scripts/data_process.sh
```
This will merge the training set of NQ and HotpotQA as the training data, and merge the test/dev sets of `nq,triviaqa,popqa,hotpotqa,2wikimultihopqa,musique,bamboogle` as the test set.

## üöÄReproduction

### Retirever Server

Before running the code for training/evaluation, you need to load the retrieval server first:
```bash
conda activate faiss_env
bash retrieval_launch.sh
```
This will start a server listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/retrieve`.

### Training

To reproduce the result in the paper (Table 1), run the following code for training:
```bash
conda activate autorefine
bash cmd/train.sh
```
The script above will train the model for 300 steps while saving checkpoints with (1) highest reward (2) highest evaluation accuracy.

If you want to log the results onto `wandb`, you may set the `wandb_token` and `WAND_PROJECT` variables in the scripts to your wandb token and prefered project name.

### Inference

For evaluation, run:
```bash
conda activate autorefine
bash cmd/eval.sh
```
